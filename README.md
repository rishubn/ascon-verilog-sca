# Side-Channel Protected Hardware Design of [Ascon-128 and Ascon-Hash (v1.2)](https://ascon.iaik.tugraz.at)

[Ascon](https://ascon.iaik.tugraz.at) is a family of authenticated encryption and hashing algorithms designed to be lightweight and easy to implement, even with added countermeasures against side-channel attacks. Ascon has been selected as new standard for lightweight cryptography in the [NIST Lightweight Cryptography competition](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2023/02/nist-selects-lightweight-cryptography-algorithms-protect-small-devices) (2019â€“2023). Ascon has also been selected as the primary choice for lightweight authenticated encryption in the final portfolio of the [CAESAR competition](https://competitions.cr.yp.to/caesar.html) (2014-2019).

This verilog implementation of Ascon is based off of the [Verilog Ascon implementation](https://github.com/rprimas/ascon-verilog) by Robert Primas. The verilog version uses a simpler interface that considerably reduces the size of the code base. The main interface changes are:
- t-order protection via NUM_SHARES paramater
- Some signals have been removed (see [Interface](#Interface) section).
- Bus width is fixed to 32*NUM_SHARES bits.
- Padding of inputs/outputs is shifted to software.

Besides the interface changes, this code base comes with:
- A more permissive CC0 license.
- A low amount of external dependencies, i.e., Python, Verilator, and optionally GTKWave.
- Easy instructions for simulation/debugging using open-source tools.

## Interface

The interface of the Ascon core is similar to [GMU's crypto core interface (Figure 5.1)](https://cryptography.gmu.edu/athena/LWC/LWC_HW_Implementers_Guide.pdf) that was often used during the [NIST standardization for lightweight authenticated encryption](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/lightweight-cryptography/).
The following changes to the GMU crypto core interface were made:
- Removed signals:
  - `bdi_valid_bytes`, `bdi_pad_loc`, `bdi_size`
  - `fdi_ready`, `fdi_valid`, `fdi_data`
  - `fdo_ready`, `fdo_valid`, `fdo_data`
  - `bdo_valid_bytes`, `end_of_block`, `key_update`
- Renamed signals:
  - `decrypt_in` -> `decrypt`
  - `hash_in` -> `hash`
  - `msg_auth`, `msg_auth_valid`, `msg_auth_ready` -> `auth`, `auth_valid`, `auth_ready` 

The resulting (simplified) interface of the Ascon core is shown here:

You can have a look at `rtl/tb.sv` for an example of how the Ascon core interface can be used.

## Quick Start

- Install the Icarus Verilog (iverilog) open-source verilog simulator:
  - See `https://steveicarus.github.io/iverilog/usage/installation.html`.
  - Tested with version 12.0 and flags `-g2005-sv`, `-g2009`, and `-g2012`.
- Execute verilog test bench:
  - `make`
  - Runs `rtl/tb.sv` using the **v1** variant of the Ascon core and `tv/tv.txt` as input.
  - For other variants use `make v2` etc..
- Execute verilog test bench and show resulting wave forms:
  - `make wave`
  - Same as `make` but also opens the resulting `tb.vcd` in GTKWave.
  - For other variants use `make v2_wave` etc..

## Automatic Generation and Execution of Test Vectors

- `python run_tb.py -s`
  - Generate a new `tv/tv.txt`, run `rtl/tb.sv` using **v1** of the Ascon core, and compare output to the Ascon software implementation in `ascon.py`.
  - For other variants add `-v 2` etc..
- `python run_tb.py -w`
  - Same as `python run_tb.py -s` except the entire process is repeated for many inputs with different lengths.
  - For other variants add `-v 2` etc..
